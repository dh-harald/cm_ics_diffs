+/*
+ * UBI device creation (the same as MTD device attachment)
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * MTD devices may be attached using %UBI_IOCATT ioctl command of the UBI
+ * control device. The caller has to properly fill and pass
+ * &struct ubi_attach_req object - UBI will attach the MTD device specified in
+ * the request and return the newly created UBI device number as the ioctl
+ * return value.
+ *
+ * UBI device deletion (the same as MTD device detachment)
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * An UBI device maybe deleted with %UBI_IOCDET ioctl command of the UBI
+ * control device.
+ *
+ * UBI volume creation
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * UBI volumes are created via the %UBI_IOCMKVOL ioctl command of UBI character
+ * device. A &struct ubi_mkvol_req object has to be properly filled and a
+ * pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
+ *
+ * UBI volume deletion
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To delete a volume, the %UBI_IOCRMVOL ioctl command of the UBI character
+ * device should be used. A pointer to the 32-bit volume ID hast to be passed
+ * to the ioctl.
+ *
+ * UBI volume re-size
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To re-size a volume, the %UBI_IOCRSVOL ioctl command of the UBI character
+ * device should be used. A &struct ubi_rsvol_req object has to be properly
+ * filled and a pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
+ *
+ * UBI volumes re-name
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To re-name several volumes atomically at one go, the %UBI_IOCRNVOL command
+ * of the UBI character device should be used. A &struct ubi_rnvol_req object
+ * has to be properly filled and a pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
+ *
+ * UBI volume update
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * Volume update should be done via the %UBI_IOCVOLUP ioctl command of the
+ * corresponding UBI volume character device. A pointer to a 64-bit update
+ * size should be passed to the ioctl. After this, UBI expects user to write
+ * this number of bytes to the volume character device. The update is finished
+ * when the claimed number of bytes is passed. So, the volume update sequence
+ * is something like:
+ *
+ * fd = open("/dev/my_volume");
+ * ioctl(fd, UBI_IOCVOLUP, &image_size);
+ * write(fd, buf, image_size);
+ * close(fd);
+ *
+ * Logical eraseblock erase
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To erase a logical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBER ioctl command of the
+ * corresponding UBI volume character device should be used. This command
+ * unmaps the requested logical eraseblock, makes sure the corresponding
+ * physical eraseblock is successfully erased, and returns.
+ *
+ * Atomic logical eraseblock change
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * Atomic logical eraseblock change operation is called using the %UBI_IOCEBCH
+ * ioctl command of the corresponding UBI volume character device. A pointer to
+ * a &struct ubi_leb_change_req object has to be passed to the ioctl. Then the
+ * user is expected to write the requested amount of bytes (similarly to what
+ * should be done in case of the "volume update" ioctl).
+ *
+ * Logical eraseblock map
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To map a logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBMAP
+ * ioctl command should be used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_map_req object is
+ * expected to be passed. The ioctl maps the requested logical eraseblock to
+ * a physical eraseblock and returns.  Only non-mapped logical eraseblocks can
+ * be mapped. If the logical eraseblock specified in the request is already
+ * mapped to a physical eraseblock, the ioctl fails and returns error.
+ *
+ * Logical eraseblock unmap
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To unmap a logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBUNMAP
+ * ioctl command should be used. The ioctl unmaps the logical eraseblocks,
+ * schedules corresponding physical eraseblock for erasure, and returns. Unlike
+ * the "LEB erase" command, it does not wait for the physical eraseblock being
+ * erased. Note, the side effect of this is that if an unclean reboot happens
+ * after the unmap ioctl returns, you may find the LEB mapped again to the same
+ * physical eraseblock after the UBI is run again.
+ *
+ * Check if logical eraseblock is mapped
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To check if a logical eraseblock is mapped to a physical eraseblock, the
+ * %UBI_IOCEBISMAP ioctl command should be used. It returns %0 if the LEB is
+ * not mapped, and %1 if it is mapped.
+ *
+ * Set an UBI volume property
+ * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ *
+ * To set an UBI volume property the %UBI_IOCSETPROP ioctl command should be
+ * used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_set_prop_req object is expected to be
+ * passed. The object describes which property should be set, and to which value
+ * it should be set.

+ * device is passed in @ubi_num. UBI may automatically assign the number if
+ * @UBI_DEV_NUM_AUTO is passed. In this case, the device number is returned in
+ * @ubi_num.
+ *
+ * Most applications should pass %0 in @vid_hdr_offset to make UBI use default
+ * offset of the VID header within physical eraseblocks. The default offset is
+ * the next min. I/O unit after the EC header. For example, it will be offset

+ * As the boot-loader would not normally need to read EC headers (unless it

+ * be 2KiB-64 bytes = 1984. Note, that this position is not even 512-bytes
